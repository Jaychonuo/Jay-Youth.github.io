# About Me

<img src="https://jaychonuo.github.io/zhoujiayong.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Jiayong ZHOU(周嘉勇)**.

I am a mphil student in **Red Bird Program** at The Hong kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou). Given my previous academic background,a B.Eng in biomedical engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech), I cultivate some skills and knowledges on bio-materials, synthetic biology, circuit simulation and design, deep learning and image processing. Currently, I am working on computer vision utilized in medical images.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - jzhou240@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn or 11910606@mail.sustech.edu.cn

## Research Interests

- Brain Computer Interface in Rehabilitation 
- Synthetic Biology 
- Deep Learning in Medical Image Processing 
- Microelectronics 

What I am really keen on and devoted to from an early age is the attempt to substitute impaired or senescent organs or reserve crucial consciousness under the poignant scenarios, either formidable cancers or adverse accidents. Combination materials and biology with electronically advanced development could be a comprehensive method to resolve those human diseases veritably, and that’s one of the reasons I decided to major in biomedical engineering. Besides, I got exposed to versatile courses related to image processing, machine learning, and numerous data processing curriculums. In hope that what I have learned could assist me in the realm of digital healthcare or medical data interpretation, for a better modern therapeutic outcome efficiently. The versatile research experiences in SUSTech show me interdisciplinary insight and I firmly believe what I distinguish from other possible candidates might be the enrichment of that multidisciplinary knowledge, relevant project experiences, and solid experimental skills learned in SUSTech, which I have always appreciated for.
