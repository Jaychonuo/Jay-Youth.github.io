## Research Experiences

- #### **Bacterial-encapsulation Natural Polymeric Microspheres (Bachelor Thesis)**

  <br>Utilization of various FDA-approved biomaterials and fabrication approaches to produce bacterium encapsulation microspheres employed in oral administration and magnetically controlled movement.
  
  

- #### **Two-Electrode ECG Front End Common Mode Repression Circuit Design**

  Novel circuit simulation and PCB establishment to enable common mode rejection and realize two-electrode ECG signal acquisition effectively.

  

  #### **Engineered Bacterium with Controllable Suicide Gene Induced by L-Arabinose**

  Design of exogenous plasmid transferred into *escherichia coli*, endow the capability of controllable suicide characteristics for a relatively safe and green bacterial lysis.

  

  #### **Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) Based Brain-Computer Interface**

  Work on reconstructing a 48-character SSVEP-based BCI spelling system employing a novel stimulus coding method, which can code 48 commands with 4 frequencies and their combination.
